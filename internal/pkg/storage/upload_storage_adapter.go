package storage

// upload_storage_adapter.go is intentionally removed.
// UploadStorageAdapter bridged the old UploadStorage interface to the storage.Storage interface
// as part of the 2-phase upload system with presigned URLs. Both interfaces are now gone.
// LocalStorage directly implements the new minimal Storage interface.
